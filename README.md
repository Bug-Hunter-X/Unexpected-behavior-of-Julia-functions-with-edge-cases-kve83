# Julia Function Edge Case Issues

This repository demonstrates some unexpected behavior that can occur in Julia functions when dealing with edge cases, specifically empty arrays or zero values as inputs.  The `bug.jl` file contains example functions that highlight these issues.  The `bugSolution.jl` file provides potential solutions and improved function implementations.

The problems stem from not explicitly handling edge cases within the function logic leading to unexpected or undefined behavior.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `bug.jl` file using the Julia REPL (e.g., `julia bug.jl`).
4. Observe the output and compare it to the expected behavior as documented in the code comments.
